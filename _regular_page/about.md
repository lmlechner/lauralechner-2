My name is Laura Lechner, and I'm a film director. I am currently working as a digital video producer at Columbia University in New York, while freelancing as an editor, art director, and an event and portrait photographer. <br>
<br/>
In my work, I strive to find the poetry in everyday existence. I'm drawn to stories that touch on identity, intimacy, love, and obsession. I also dabble in live performance, puppetry, and music, and am always seeking collaborative experiences with other artists.  Please, <a href="contact.html">get in touch</a> if you'd like to work together.<br/>

If you're interested in booking a wedding or a personal photo session, please <a href="contact.html">complete this form</a> and fill me in on the date and give me an idea of what you're looking for. I look forward to speaking with you!
