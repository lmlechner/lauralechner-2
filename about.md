My name is Laura Lechner, and I'm a film director, editor, and producer. <br>

In my work, I strive to find the poetry in everyday existence. I'm drawn to stories that touch on identity, intimacy, love, and obsession. I also dabble in live performance, puppetry, and music, and often center my films around these different mediums. I am an active member of <a href="https://www.thefilmshop.org/">Filmshop</a> a New York-based collective of independent filmmakers committed to developing new work through peer support and collaboration. I currently work as a Multimedia Producer for WNET's <a href="https://www.nyc-arts.org/">NYC-Arts</a>. <br>  

I am always seeking collaborative experiences with other artists. Please [get in touch]({{ site.url }}/contact/) if you'd like to work together. <br>
