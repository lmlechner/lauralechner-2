My name is Laura Lechner, and I'm a film director and editor. <br> <br>

In my work, I strive to find the poetry in everyday existence. I'm drawn to stories that touch on identity, intimacy, love, and obsession. I also dabble in live performance, puppetry, and music, and am always seeking collaborative experiences with other artists.  Please, [get in touch]({{ site.url }}/contact/) if you'd like to work together. <br> <br>

If you're interested in booking a wedding or a personal photo session, please [complete this form]({{ site.url }}/contact/) and fill me in on the date and give me an idea of what you're looking for. I look forward to speaking with you!
