My name is Laura Lechner, and I'm a film director, editor, and producer. <br>

In my work, I strive to find the poetry in everyday existence. I'm drawn to stories that touch on identity, intimacy, love, and obsession. I also dabble in live performance, puppetry, and music, and often center my films around these different mediums. I am always seeking collaborative experiences with other artists. Please [get in touch]({{ site.url }}/contact/) if you'd like to work together. <br>

I am also a photographer. If you're interested in booking a wedding or a personal photo session, please [complete this form]({{ site.url }}/contact/). I often shoot in collaboration with my husband Joe Valenzuela, a cinematographer and photographer. You can check out our wedding porfolio [here](https://joeandlauravalenzuela.pixieset.com/). I look forward to speaking with you!
