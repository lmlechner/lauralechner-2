Dee Dee is an outsider who longs to feel authentic in their own skin. Feeling overwhelmed and out of place in their hometown of Minneapolis, Dee Dee struggles to find their authentic voice, let alone a strong support network or regular employment. At the start of the film, Dee Dee is lonely, and struggling with their identity as a gender non-conforming individual; they are exhausted by how much they have to “pretend” in order to be accepted by mainstream society. Juggling freelance work and low-paying part-time jobs, they are broke and running out of options. 

When a friend hooks Dee Dee up with a job as a nanny out in the suburbs, they make an immediate and deep connection with the baby that they are hired to care for. As time goes on, Dee Dee becomes closer and closer to the entire family, including baby Clara’s mother (Annie) and father (Scott). Dee Dee finds unexpected personal fulfillment while serving as a nanny within this seemingly “picture-perfect” heteronormative suburban home, and goes on to imagine an alternative identity and future. Gradually, Dee Dee begins to experiment in expressing their gender identity by mirroring the appearance and behavior of Annie, and eventually discovers a surprisingly authentic sense of self. Ultimately, Dee Dee’s previous preconceptions of gender identity, relationships, and love are broken, and they emerge from this experience reborn
