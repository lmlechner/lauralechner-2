I'm happy to announce that <a href="http://fromtheheartproductions.com">From the Heart Productions</a> will be our film's fiscal sponsor! From The Heart's mission is to "encourage and bring to fruition unique projects with compelling stories that might otherwise have never been made" - sounds like "Kim" is a perfect fit!  I'll be updating this page soon with more information about ways that you can help support the film.  In the meantime, check out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kimthefilm/?ref=aymt_homepage_panel">our Facebook page</a> and please 'like' it to stay up to date with "Kim."
