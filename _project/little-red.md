A new short film co-directed by Laura Lechner & [David Hanzal](https://davidhanzaltheatre.carbonmade.com/). <br> <br>


A little girl goes into the woods, and discovers what big teeth she actually has. A short film that combines puppets and live actors to re-imagine this classic fairy tale into a story about power, transformation, and choosing one's own path. <br><br>
