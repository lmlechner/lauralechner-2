A new short film co-directed by Laura Lechner & [David Hanzal](https://davidhanzaltheatre.carbonmade.com/). <br> <br>

Regan and Barbara’s two-person puppetry troupe is unraveling at the edges. On opening night, their strained interpersonal dynamic jumps from behind-the-scenes tension to in-front-of-the curtain drama as they prepare to present their newest work. While performing their dream-like adaptation of Little Red Riding Hood, fiction and reality intertwines as the two young women are magically transported into the strange and surreal world of their puppet show. <br> <br>

Little Red is a short film that combines puppets and live actors to re-imagine the classic fairy tale that you thought you knew as a new story about power, transformation and choosing one’s own path. <br><br>
