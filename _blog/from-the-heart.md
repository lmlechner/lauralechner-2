I'm happy to announce that From the Heart Productions will be our film's fiscal sponsor! From The Heart's mission is to "encourage and bring to fruition unique projects with compelling stories that might otherwise have never been made" - sounds like "Kim" is a perfect fit! I'll be updating this page soon with more information about ways that you can help support the film. In the meantime, check out our Facebook page and please 'like' it to stay up to date with "Kim."
