I'm very excited to announce that Little Red is an official selection of the <a href="http://theartistsforum.org/filmfest/affestnyc.html/">Artists Forum Festival of the Moving Image</a>. Little Red will screen on Friday, Oct. 12 at 7pm at the Greenwich House Music School at the Renee Weiler Concert Hall in New York City.
