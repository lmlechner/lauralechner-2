I'm very excited to announce that *Little Red* is an official selection of the <a href="http://theartistsforum.org/filmfest/filmfest2018.html/">Artists Forum Festival of the Moving Image</a>. *Little Red* will screen alongside 40 other shorts from around the world at the Greenwich House Music School at the Renee Weiler Concert Hall in Manhattan's Greenwich Village. Our film will be shown on Friday, Oct. 12th at 7pm - the screening will be followed by a Q & A. For more information, please visit the <a href="http://theartistsforum.org/index.html/">Artists Forum's site</a>.
